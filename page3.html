    <h2 style="color:blue ;">Semantic Elements</h2>
    <p>When building web pages , we use a combination of non- semantic <span style="color:orange ;">HTML</span>and semantic <span style="color:orange ;">HTML</span>. THE word semantic means <i><strong>"relating to meaning"</strong></i>, so semantic elements
        elements provide information about the content between the opening and closinh tags.</p>

    <p>By using Semantic <span style="color:orange ;">HTML</span> we select <span style="color:orange ;">HTML</span> elements based on their meaning , not on how they are presented . Elements such as <code><</code>div <code>></code> and
        <code><</code>span <code>></code> are not semantic elements since they provide no context as to what is inside of those tags </p>

    <p> <br> For Example , instead of using <code><</code>div<code>></code> element to contain our header information , we could use a <code><</code>header <code>></code> eleent , which is used as a heading section , by using <code><</code>header <code>></code>        tag instead of a <code><</code>div<code>></code>, we provide context as to what information is inside of the opening and closing tag .</p>

    <h2 style="color:blue ;"> WHY USE SEMANTIC ELEMENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Accessibility:</h4> Semantic <span>HTML</span> makes webpages accessible for mobile devices and for people with disabilities as well.This is because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better. </li>
        <li>
            <h4>SEO:</h4>It improves the <b>SEO,</b>or Search Engine Optimization,which is the process of increasing the number of people that visist your webpages.With better <b>SEO,</b>search engines are better able to identify the content of your website
            and weight the mpst important content appropriately. </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Easy to Understand:</h4>Semantic <span>HTML</span>also makes the website's source code easier to read for otherweb developers.</li>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic <span style="color: orange;">HTML</span>to going into a store with no signs on the aisles. Since the aisles aren't labeled,you don't know what products are in those aisles. However,
        stores that do have signs for each aisles make it a lot easier to find the item you need,just like Semantic <span style="color: orange;">HTML.</span> </p>
